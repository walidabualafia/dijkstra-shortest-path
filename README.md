# shortest-path
This program is designed to take in a text file of commands and data to generate a graph data structure, and then runs a Priority Queue implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices. Initial project provided by Dr. Phillip Kirlin (@pkirlin), completed by me.
